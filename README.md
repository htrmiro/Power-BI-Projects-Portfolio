# Power-BI-Projects-Portfolio

Hello. Welcome to my Power BI portfolio github repository. 

I shall update this as i do more Power BI projects as time goes by. Thank you.

first, who am i ?
i'm a human from Lagos, Nigeria who is passionate with business, finance and sports.
It is at the intersection of these that i lie my bed. Passionate about these, from time to time, i will take on projects and write articles at this intersection.
I hope this portfolio highlights my ability to delve into data using Microsoft Power BI and helps someone watching as much as they need.
Thank you, again.

## Project 1 - Analyzing Business Performance using Power BI: A Comprehensive Dashboard Project

The goal of this project was to design interactive dashboards using Power BI. They should cater individually to four key roles in the fictitious company, Threads Ltd:
- Chief Financial Officer
- Chief Operating Officer
- Head of Sales
- Chief Executive OfficerÂ : the CEO Dashboard was created to present a high-level summary of the company's performance, combining critical KPIs from all departments.

i might deploy soon, but check it on medium and power bi service for now.
